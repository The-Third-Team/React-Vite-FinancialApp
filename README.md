## **Motivation**

Our team, initially comprising nine individuals spanning Data Science, UX, and Software Engineer, started with a shared vision to craft a user-friendly app that empowers individuals in managing their finances with unparalleled ease. As our team size fluctuated, so did our determination adapting like the leaves that sway but never break. With every transition, we embraced the metaphor of turning over a new leaf – shedding the old, embracing the new to create this app.
